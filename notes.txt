An example to be discussed : 

Lepton Universality 

 . Ref :http://arxiv.org/pdf/0807.4721v1.pdf
   Anatomy and Phenomenology of the Lepton Flavor Universality in SUSY Theories




Things we would like to mention : 

- The point of indirect searches ex :
  .  prediction of charm quark from kaon physics and/or the mass of the top qurark from B mixing. 

 
- what is the state before run I of the LHC  
 
- The "tensions" P'5, RK etc.
