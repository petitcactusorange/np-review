We chose an example of a test that can be done at LHCb and CMS/ATLAS

Questions :
- Why do we care about lepton universality ?
- What could it mean if it were to be violated ?
- What would it help to understand on the grand scheme of things?





Experimental papers :
   Measurement from LHCb :
   Phys. Rev. Lett. 113, 151601 (2014)

   A discussion from Gudrun Hiller (don't know if it's very useful...)

Need to find the CMS/ATLAS equivalent.

  Example of a review.

 . Ref: http://arxiv.org/pdf/0807.4721v1.pdf
   Anatomy and Phenomenology of the Lepton Flavor Universality in SUSY Theories

 . Ref: http://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.05164v1.pdf
   Lepton universality violation and lepton flavor conservation in B-meson decays
   Interesting "For example, a connection between B-decays and top physics is pointed out"

  . Ref with a Z'
    http://arxiv.org/pdf/1508.07009v1.pdf  

Things we would like to mention :
- The point of indirect searches ex :
  .  prediction of charm quark from kaon physics and/or the mass of the top qurark from B mixing.


- what is the state before run I of the LHC

- The "tensions" P'5, RK etc.
